<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This table has been created as part of the manuscript:
<strong>Competing risk models using copulas: A comprehensive
review</strong> with the aim of consolidating articles that has covered
CR models using copulas. The provision of open-source and
well-documented software is essential to ensure the widespread adoption
of new statistical methods. Reproducibility is crucial in the
development and evaluation of new methods. The table provides such
details, and was constructed using R package: <em>reactable</em> (Lin,
2023).</p>
